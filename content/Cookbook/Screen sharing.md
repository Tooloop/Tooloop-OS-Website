Tooloop OS has a [VNC server](https://github.com/LibVNC/x11vnc) installed. VNC however is disabled by default.  
Turn it on in the _Services_ section of the [Control Center](/Getting%20started/Control%20Center) or using the terminal command `tooloop-vnc-on`.

Now you can remotely connect to your Tooloop Box screen using your favourite VNC tool.
The default password is `tooloop`.
