You can install openframework using the [optionals installer](#install-optional-stuff).

Copy your app (i.e. the `bin/` folder of your openframeworks project) over to `/assets/presentation/[YOUR_PROJECT]`.

Run your application, e.g.

<pre class="command-line" data-prompt="~$"><code class="language-bash">/assets/presentation/[YOUR_PROJECT]/[YOUR_APPLICATION]</code></pre>
