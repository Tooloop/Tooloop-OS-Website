From within the [Unity build settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BuildSettings.html) you can export a Linux x86_64 application.  
You might want to have a look at the [player settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsStandalone.html) before.

Once you have exported your applicatione, simple copy the whole export folder to `/assest/presentation` and start it like this:

<pre class="command-line" data-prompt="~$"><code class="language-bash">/assets/presentation/[YOUR_FOLDER]/[YOUR_APPLUCATION]</code></pre>
