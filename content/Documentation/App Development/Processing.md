You can install Processing using the [optionals installer](#install-optional-stuff).

Run your application, e.g.

<pre class="command-line" data-prompt="~$"><code class="language-bash">/assets/presentation/processing-x.x.x/processing-java --sketch=/assets/presentation/processing-3.0.2/modes/java/examples/Demos/Graphics/Planets --present</code></pre>

Obviously you'll have to change the processing version in the example.
