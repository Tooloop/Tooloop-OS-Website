[Tooloop OS](http://tooloop.org) is a platform for media artists to safely and easily develop and deploy multimedia installations.

Tooloop OS is based on [Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) and the super lightweight window manager [Openbox](http://openbox.org). Both are customized to fit the needs of live and public multimedia installations.

Many ideas of Tooloop OS are based on [this article](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/installation_up_4evr_linux.html) in the openframeworks book on keeping a linux installation up forever. However Tooloop tries to take the aproach one step further. 

Tooloop OS comes with a set of [management and maintenance tools](Getting%20started/Control%20Center) and a set of [default/example apps](https://github.com/tooloop/Tooloop-Packages). You can configure and control it over the network and get built-in health and confidence monitoring.


# Who should use it?

Tooloop is designed for any kind of public, live system such as museum installations, digital signage, kiosks, etc.

Being Ubuntu based, Tooloop OS can run pretty much any Linux software. However itâ€™s specifically designed with these frameworks in mind:

- [Unity](https://unity3d.com)
- [openframeworks](http://openframeworks.cc/)
- [Processing](https://processing.org)
- [Kivy](https://kivy.org/)

If you have written an application using one of these, Tooloop might just be what you need.
