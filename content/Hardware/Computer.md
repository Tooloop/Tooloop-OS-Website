            <p>If you have specific hardware requirements for your project, you probably want to buy new. Whether you buy a pre-assembled box with professional support or build one yourself, is up to your preference.</p>
            <p>We do, however strongly recommend the <strong>use of industrial grade components</strong> (see <a href="#Recommendations">recommendations below</a>).

            <p>Tooloop OS runs on a potatoe (see <a href="#Requirements">Requirements</a>).</p>
            <p>If you have old hardware, that still meets the <a href="#Recommendations">recommendations</a> it’s a wonderful oppurtunity to save some money and protect the environment by re-using your old computers.</p>

<a name="Requirements"></a>
## Requirements

Tooloop OS is based on Ubuntu and as such runs on a wide range of hardware.
The [Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/system-requirements) recommends:

- Min. 3 GB of RAM
- Min. 25 GB of storage

It will be diffucult to find a box with specs below those requirements and thus 
there is almost no hard limit on hardware.

## Recommendations

<div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
        <h3><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-clipboard-check has-text-primary"></i></span> Chassis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Size</strong> doesn’t matter as much as you think. Resist the urge of going too small! Do you really, really need to? Small = hot.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooling</strong> does matter. Passive cooling is mostly not for us media people. Not if your app uses at least some graphics power.</li>
            <li><strong>Dust filters</strong> are the logic consequence of active cooling.</li>
            <li><strong>Silence</strong> is nice. In a museum, a showroom or in a theatre we want to be as silent as possible. Not on the expense of bad cooling, though.</li>
            <li><strong>Rack-mountable</strong> It’s safe, it’s easy to reach and maintain. If you can, put it in a rack.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <h3><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-clipboard-check has-text-primary"></i></span> Longevity</h3>
        <p>Industrial and server grade components are built to last. They withstand high temperatures, run 24/7 and are usually available for years.</p>
        <h3><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-clipboard-check has-text-primary"></i></span> BIOS</h3>
        <p>Enable quiet boot and wake-on-lan.</p>
