The easiest way to copy files on the machine is using an SFTP browser like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/).

You will find a volume mounted at `/assets`. That’s the space to put all your files. It contains five folders:

|           Path          |                                   Description                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/assets/presentation/` | put your app here                                                             |
| `/assets/data/`         | put your images, videos, etc. here                                            |
| `/assets/screenshots/`  | screenshots will be saved here                                                |
| `/assets/logs/`         | log files, well if your app saves ’em here                                    |
| `/assets/apps/`         | app bundles that are locally available to install through the settings server |
