Title: The desktop

This screenshot shows the Tooloop OS desktop in all it’s glory. Yup, that’s all of it :-)  
By the way, this is also a screenshot of the boot process.

There is however one more thing. Move your mouse, trust me, it’s there. It’s just automatically hidden.

Now click into the background. This will open the one thing, the desktop has for you, the menu.

That’s pretty much it. Remember, *Tooloop OS* is meant to get out of the way.
