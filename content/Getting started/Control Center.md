It’s a also web application and as such you can open it in a browser on any machine in the network and remotely control the machine. It also has an extensive [REST API](/REST%20API/General) so it can easily be integrated in other tools or building automation.

You can open it

- from a browser on the network (using the IP address of your machine)
- from the [desktop menu](The%20desktop)
- from the [terminal](Terminal%20access) `tooloop-settings`

# Code

The control center has its’ own [GitHub project](https://github.com/tooloop/Tooloop-Control).
